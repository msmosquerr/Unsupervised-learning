# Unsupervised-learning
In the file "Clustering_Algorithms_MylleeMosquera", 5 clustering algorithms are implemented: Mountain, Subtractive, Kmeans, Fuzzy Kmeans, and DBSCAN.

In this implementation, 5 norms are used for Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Manhattan, Cosine, and P-norm distance measurement. Additionally, transformations are applied to the database to carry out learning in high and low-dimensional spaces. Cluster validation techniques are used for determining the effectiveness of a clustering algorithm, and the Dunn index is implemented.

Requirements: databases in ".xlsx", ".csv", and ".txt" formats are expected. Any other type of data may not be read.
